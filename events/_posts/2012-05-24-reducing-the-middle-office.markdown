EuroClojure is the first 2-day, full-blown conference in Europe for the Clojure community. [Jon Pither](http://twitter.com/jonpither) and [Hakan Raberg](http://twitter.com/hakanraberg) are presenting a talk on their experience of introducing Clojure to investment banking.

"In December 2011, a small ragtag group of men from around all of Europe started to introduce Clojure in a remote corner of an investment bank. This is their story. Reconstructed from torn index cards, corrupted IRC chat logs, broken builds â€“ and hearts."
