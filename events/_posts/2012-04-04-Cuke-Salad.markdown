[James Martin](http://twitter.com/jmrtn) and [Antony Marcano](http://twitter.com/AntonyMarcano) extoll the virtues of describing the required capabilities of a system over solutions. 

Many teams don't realise that their Cukes are actually describing the solution they're building rather than the user-capability they're enabling. The closer to the solution our Cukes are, the less flexibility we have and the less maintainable our scenarios become. Focusing on the user-capability we're enabling gives us more options for fulfilling the needs of our users and ensures that scenarios need to be maintained only when the actual user-need changes. In this session we'll explore the 'Roles, Tasks and Actions' model used in User Centred Design, to write capability-focused scenarios that increase the maintainability and relevance of our Cukes for the entire product team.
