Continuous Integration (C.I) is integral to Agile. Along with practices like TDD & Pair Programming, C.I is followed on most Agile projects to assist successful project delivery.

In EXPERTALKS - April, we will show how to implement Continuous Integration using the Jenkins tool.

As is the tradition with all EXPERTALKS events, EXPERTALKS - April will also be a hands-on session.
It will include demonstration of a live project which uses Jenkins for C.I. This will be followed by a workshop where participants will get to use Jenkins to implement C.I for a sample project.
