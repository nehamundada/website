[Jon Pither](http://twitter.com/jonpither) & [Hakan Raberg](http://twitter.com/hakanraberg) introduced Clojure to a global team at an investment bank in December 2011 on a large established Java code-base, but now, how do they deal with the cultural differences this creates, and how to treat the Java legacy?

They discuss the introduction of Clojure, some unexpected lessons learned, and the evolution of their testing strategy beyond the REPL. They will also talk about some of the challenges faced in productionising their Clojure code.
