    <h3>O2 Priority Moments management system</h3>
    <p>We were brought in to deliver the central component of the system - offer management and targeting. By working closely with O2 we ensured the original service was delivered in 6 months, from initial inception to going live. To achieve the tight timescales and meet the potential scaling and performance expectations, we chose to employ NoSQL technologies and a cloud hosting solution. We have continued to develop and grow the product with O2 since its launch.</p>
