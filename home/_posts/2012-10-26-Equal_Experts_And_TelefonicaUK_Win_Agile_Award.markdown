Equal Experts was also a finalist in the Best Use of Agile in the Private Sector category.  The results were announced at an awards ceremony and dinner at The Grand Connaught Rooms in central London on Thursday 25th October 2012.

Equal Experts has a long history of delivering successful bespoke software development projects to blue chip clients by applying agile methods.  Since its inception in 2005, Equal Experts has focused on applying not only Agile management practices, but also the rigorous technical practices that are the foundation of any successful Agile delivery.

“Agile is at the core of everything we do at Equal Experts,” said Ryan Sikorsky, Director.  “To us, Agile isn’t just about stand up meetings and sprints.  None of this works without experienced developers who have spent years honing their skills and learning rigorous development practices, such as test driven development and continuous integration.

The exceptional results achieved at Telefonica UK were made possible by the unwavering commitment and support of the Telefonica UK Online department for the last two years. Every single team member of the Online team, from senior management to all the people on the ground, focussed on creating the right environment, removed blockers for the delivery team to focus on what they do best, and enabled them to work closely with the business stakeholders,” Ryan added.

The objective of the UK Agile Awards is to recognise the people, projects and products that have contributed to the success of Agile in the UK.
