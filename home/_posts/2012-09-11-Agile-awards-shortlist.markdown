Equal Experts has made the short list in two categories of this year’s UK Agile Awards, the penultimate stage of the 2012 programme.  Finalists in the “Best Use of Agile in the Private Sector,” and the “Best Agile Team” categories for their work at Telefonica UK, Equal Experts beat out stiff competition to make it this far.

Equal Experts has a long history of delivering successful bespoke software development projects to blue chip clients by applying agile methods.  Since its inception in 2005, Equal Experts has focused on applying not only Agile management practices, but also the rigorous technical practices that are the foundation of any successful Agile delivery.

“Agile is at the core of everything we do at Equal Experts,” said Ryan Sikorsky, Director.  “To us, Agile isn’t just about stand up meetings and sprints.  None of this works without experienced developers who have spent years honing their skills and learning rigorous development practices, such as test driven development and continuous integration.

The exceptional results achieved at Telefonica UK were made possible by the support of senior management in the Online department who created the right environment for the delivery team to focus on what they do best, and enable them to work closely with the business stakeholders,” Ryan added.

The objective of the UK Agile Awards is to recognise the people, projects and products that have contributed to the success of Agile in the UK.

An Equal Experts team plus VIP customers from Telefonica UK will attend the awards ceremony and dinner on 25th October in London.
