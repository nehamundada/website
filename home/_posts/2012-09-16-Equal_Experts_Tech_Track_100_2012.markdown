Equal Experts has claimed this year’s 11th spot in the prestigious [Sunday Times Hiscox Tech Track 100](http://www.fasttrack.co.uk/fasttrack/leagues/tech100leaguetable.asp?siteID=3&searchName=&yr=2012&sort=num&area1=99), a league table that ranks Britain’s 100 private tech (TMT) companies with the fastest growing sales over the last three years.

“We are absolutely delighted to have made the list. This is particularly gratifying when you know how hard it is for SME’s to sell bespoke software development services vs. off-the-shelf software. And it gets even more challenging when delivering complex enterprise systems for risk-averse corporates – which is our main focus,” says Thomas Granier, MD of Equal Experts.  “I founded Equal Experts 7 years ago because I was frustrated with how most IT Professional Service firms were run.  I was looking for a more equitable business structure for both the Customer paying for the service, and for the Consultant performing that service.  It has been an exciting time watching the company grow and flourish with our unique approach, particularly during these tough economic times,” Thomas added.

With an average annual sales growth of 154.90% over the last three years, Equal Experts listing in the Sunday Times Hiscox Tech Track 100 league table actually topped every other provider of bespoke software services and was the only one of its kind making the top 20.

“Making this list has to be attributed to our team of 120 ultra-talented, multi-disciplined consultants” says Thomas.  “But it also happened because our largest Customers were visionary enough to understand that the expertise and the quality we bring trumps low day-rates when it comes to delivering complex enterprise systems – and this despite the fact that most corporate procurements are still unable to objectively measure the overall value delivered by their IT suppliers.

We believe that the key to handling successfully our growth has been our flat structure, low overheads and our focus on building a community of like minded people, where both our employees and our associate freelancers are valued and contribute equally”

“The long hours have definitely paid off,” adds Ryan Sikorsky, Director, Equal Experts.  “Also, our mix of industry leading expertise, outstanding time to market, innovative technology and low cost of ownership solutions has proved a winning combination,” Ryan added.
