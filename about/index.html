   <h2>What we can offer</h2>
   <section>
    <h3>Outstanding time to market</h3>
    <p>We bring new software products to market fast. By taking a value driven approach to building software we focus on delivering the core product as quickly as possible. Find out how we <a href="/home/O2-priority-moments.html">developed the O2 Priority Moments product</a> from inception to delivery in a matter of months.</p>
   </section>
   <section>
    <h3>Industry-leading expertise</h3>
    <p>All of our developers have chosen to make a career out of building software, rather than moving into management. Many of them have written books, give seminars or speak at conferences. Nowhere else can you find software delivery teams where the majority of people have over ten years experience building software. <a href="/ournetwork/" title="Equal Experts Network">Find out more about the network</a>.</p>

    <h3>Innovative technology</h3>
    <p>We have put in place development processes that allow us to safely introduce new technologies to large enterprise environments. If new technologies are introduced responsibly the benefits to organisations can be game changing. Our rigorous approach to building and testing software reduces the risk of adopting innovative technologies.</p>
   </section>
   <section>
    <h3>Open Source technology</h3>
    <p>We use the right tool for the job, but when it makes sense we will use Open Source software. We find that Open Source frees our clients from the tyranny of expensive licenses and provides better technical support at a lower cost. </p>
   </section>
   <section>
    <h3>Low cost of ownership</h3>
    <p>Our cost of delivery is lower because we have industry leading developers producing simple software to solve complex problems. We reduce total cost of ownership by using enterprise friendly Open Source technology.</p>
