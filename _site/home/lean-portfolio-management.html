    <h2>Using Kanban to manage a large portfolio of projects</h2>
	<p class="blogdate">03 May 2012</p>
	
	
	<section class="blogarticle">
	 <p>I am working in the technology group of a large, multinational financial company. We work with other business groups within the firm to deliver projects varying in size from very small (e.g. a straightforward content update to the company website) to very large (e.g. implementing a set of new features that impact customer operations, security, compliance, etc.).</p>

<p>It&#8217;s difficult to understand - especially as a newcomer - everything that we as a group are responsible for. Commonplace questions include:</p>

<ul>
<li>how do I know whether a project is in progress or waiting to start?</li>

<li>which projects are at risk?</li>

<li>what are we doing next and do we have capacity to do so?</li>
</ul>

<p>Historically, the team used a Powerpoint template to document project updates, risks, issues and changes to the project pipeline. This is not the optimal way of sharing and communicating this information since it:</p>

<ol>
<li>lacks visibility - it is not widely available to everyone the group</li>

<li>requires effort to interpret - it is difficult to quickly find out whether a project is at risk for example</li>

<li>lacks detail in key areas - it shows the pipeline as a list but doesn&#8217;t identify type, requested by, etc.</li>
</ol>

<p>Following further discussion with the head of the group, we agreed that setting up a project portfolio board based on some <strong>Kanban</strong> principles could help address these issues as part of a wider effort to improve our effectiveness at delivering projects.</p>

<h2 id='what_we_did'>What we did</h2>

<p>Standing in front of an empty whiteboard we answered the following questions:</p>

<ol>
<li>What types of work are we asked to do?</li>

<li>Who asks us to do this work?</li>

<li>When do we get involved? When do we consider our work done?</li>

<li>How do we progress this work from start to end?</li>
</ol>

<h3 id='work_types'>Work Types</h3>

<p>We decided to differentiate work based on 3 <strong>project types</strong>: i) business-as-usual tasks, ii) small-scale enhancements and iii) larger projects. We manage each type differently (larger products have stricter budgetary contraints compared to business-as-usual tasks for example) so there is benefit in visualising this on the board.</p>

<h3 id='sources_of_work'>Sources of Work</h3>

<p>We agreed that highlighting where work originates was also a useful metric. We narrowed this down to 4 sources: 3 separate business groups and 1 catch-all bucket for requests originating from the technology group itself and/or requests affecting the company as a whole.</p>

<h3 id='defining_the_start__end_points_of_the_process'>Defining the start &amp; end points of the process</h3>

<p>We discussed this at length. Should we start with approved projects only or with informal requests for work? Do we consider a project we deploy to production as completed or are there additional steps we need to check?</p>

<p>We decided that our start point is when we find out about an idea for a project exists rather than approved projects. This should allow us to be more adaptive to changes in priorities since a quick approval won&#8217;t be a surprise. Our end point is the training and monitoring we need to provide for some projects (<em>note</em>, I initially thought that successfully deploying into production represented a completed project but further discussion amongst the group highlighted this last important step).</p>

<h3 id='what_does_our_process_look_like'>What does our process look like?</h3>

<p>We iterated through 2 or 3 different versions until we settled on this one (for now - we&#8217;ll review how well this is working and revise as appropriate).</p>

<p><img src='./board1.png' alt='Description' /></p>

<ul>
<li>Backlog (queue) - a holding pen for project ideas that require further thought/analysis/sign off</li>

<li>Proposal (active) - projects in this stage are undergoing analysis or waiting for official sign off to begin</li>

<li>Ready for Development (queue) - projects here are signed off and ready to pull into development</li>

<li>In Development (active)</li>

<li>In QA (active) - projects here are undergoing formal QA</li>

<li>Ready for Release (queue) - projects waiting to be included in the next release</li>

<li>Released (completed)</li>

<li>Training &amp; Monitoring (active)</li>
</ul>

<p>We didn&#8217;t add a buffer between the In Development and In QA stages. We&#8217;ll review whether we need in the future.</p>

<p>We added 4 horizontal swimlanes per source of work (see point 2 above) so that we can easily see the distribution of work between each source.</p>

<p><img src='./board2.png' alt='Description' /></p>

<p>We chose to use different colour cards per work type (see point 1) and opted to capture the following information.</p>

<p><img src='./cardlayout1.png' alt='Card Layout' /></p>

<p>Here&#8217;s an example:</p>

<p><img src='./cardlayout2.png' alt='Card Layout' /></p>

<h2 id='what_happened_next'>What happened next?</h2>

<h3 id='board_setup'>Board setup</h3>

<p>A quick and easy 10 minute task using a whiteboard (wall space is a premium in this office :-), ruler and marker. Following this, we added 1 card per project into the appropriate column on the board.</p>

<h2 id='results'>Results</h2>

<p>A couple of immediate observations: one project manager is responsible for many more projects than other PMs and - unexpectedly - we have no work in progress for one of the business groups and nothing pending in the pipeline.</p>

<p>So, how does this setup help us address the problems I mentioned earlier? The board allows us to quickly <strong>see a project&#8217;s state</strong> by look at the column the card is in. It&#8217;s accessible to everyone in the office and is practically self-explanatory. We <strong>see all upcoming projects</strong> and <strong>who&#8217;s requested them</strong> by looking at the distrubution of cards in the backlog queue. We indicate that a <strong>project is at risk</strong> by putting a pink sticky note on the card with details of the problem and who owns it. To <strong>find out more about a project</strong>, you can quickly determine its ID, budget, requesting business group, PM and target release date by looking the corresponding card and position on the board.</p>

<p>We need to do some additional investigation to determine how we use the board to help with <strong>capacity planning</strong>. We also want to answer these questions:</p>

<ul>
<li>how should we inspect/adapt this setup to see what works/doesn&#8217;t work (e.g. will adding limits to some stages of the process help)?</li>

<li>how do we make more use of the board during team meetings?</li>

<li>how do we make the board visible to our colleagues outside of the main office?</li>
</ul>
